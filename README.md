# website-prototype

  WORK IN PROGRESS

Basic personal website built with Next.js, mostly for js/css study, may be hosted for public access in the future, nothing certain though.

As of last version, most pages are just simply styled and most links are not implemented.

To do:

 - Add animations;
 - Add night mode;
 - Add slider to night mode;
 - Add external links.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
